## Overview <a name="Overview"></a>

MacroManager aims to fix some of the major issues present in current calorie tracking apps such as adding foods together to create one entry which can be reentered in the future to save time rather than having to enter five different foods every morning to log your breakfast.

MacroManager also aims to make eating tracking calories eaten in restaurants much easier and even help users to make decisions on where to eat based on what will fit their diet for that day.
